# Ten Quick Tips for Managing IT Disasters in Small Research Teams

In 2025, the US government launched an unprecedented series of attacks on its
own scientific research groups.  Twelve months later, [GitHub][github] briefly
dropped below 90% availability for the first time, and at the time of writing,
wildfires in Canada, France, Spain, and elsewhere have forced researchers from
the homes and labs. These events and others have reminded us just how fragile
research computing systems can be.

This paper is a short guide to disaster planning and recovery for a research
software team that fits comfortably around a single table.  The tips assume you
are doing everything yourself on top of your regular job, and that you *aren't*
an experienced system administrator.

## Four Kinds of Teams

Despite the disclaimer above, early versions of this guide focused primarily on
teams that run online services that other researchers use.  This version
generalizes the advice to handle three other types of groups as well.

Providing a simple online service
:   Your research group runs a [Shiny][shiny] app or a [Streamlit][streamlit]
    dashboard so that collaborators can query data.  Disasters scenarios
    include:
    -   Your cloud provider suspends your account.
    -   The graduate student who deployed the service leaves and no one else has
        credentials.
    -   Your service depends on a database that another group maintains, and
        that group shuts down on short notice.

Publishing a software package
:   Your group releases software to public registries like [PyPI][pypi] or
    [CRAN][cran] and wants those releases to survive the group's dissolution.
    Scenarios include:
    -   Your PyPI token expires and the person who created it has left.
    -   GitHub suspends your account.
    -   Your institutional web hosting is turned off.

Managing data
:   Your group produces datasets in the lab or in the field that are shared with
    collaborators and deposited in repositories.  Scenarios include:
    -   A lab server's hard drive fails.
    -   A field laptop is stolen and the data on it has not been backed up.
    -   Your data repository announces it is shutting down.

Managing a physical laboratory
:   This category includes teams working in wet labs, field stations, or with
    sample collections.  Scenarios include:
    -   A specimen freezer fails over a long weekend.
    -   A key piece of equipment is out of warranty and can no longer be serviced.
    -   The notebook containing the labeling key for a set of specimens is lost.

These categories overlap: for example, a five-person ecology lab may publish an
R package, run a Shiny dashboard for collaborators, manage a ten-year field
dataset, and maintain a wet lab with freezers and sample collections.

> **Before you start:** Many universities have research-computing groups, data
> librarians, and environmental-health-and-safety offices whose entire job is to
> help with exactly these problems. Find those people and ask for help before
> assuming you must do everything yourself. This paper tells you what to ask
> for; they can often provide it.

## Tip 1: Know your risks.

Start by making a point-form list of every service and physical asset your team
depends on. For our ecology lab, this includes where the R package is published,
where the Shiny dashboard is hosted, where the ten-year field dataset lives,
where the freezers and their contents are, and the laptops the team works
on. For a small team, this will take about an hour the first time through, and
15-30 minutes per quarter for review.

A Markdown file in a shared folder or a Google Doc is the right tool for
this. For each item, answer two questions:

1.  How long can you be without it before work stops dead? This is your
    *Recovery Time Objective* (RTO).

2.  How much data can you afford to lose: the last hour's work, the last
    day's, a week's? This is your *Recovery Point Objective* (RPO).

Next, identify the single points of failure within your control: the person
who knows the deployment process, the credit card that pays for cloud
services, the person with the only key to the -80°C freezer. For each, ask
what happens if it disappears.

## Tip 2: Make a plan.

Once you understand your risks, write a plan in a single shared document
that everyone on the team can find in thirty seconds or less. Store the
plan in at least two places that cannot fail simultaneously, such as the
shared team drive *plus* a printed copy in a desk drawer or a PDF saved on
every team member's phone. Pin the link in your team chat, and if you have
a physical office, tape a printed copy to the fridge.

State the disaster declaration criteria in plain language: "our dashboard
has been offline for more than a day", "we have found ransomware encryption
on a shared drive", or "the -80°C freezer has been above -70°C for more
than an hour". Every team member is part of the recovery team, so make sure
everyone has read the plan, understands the criteria, and knows their first
action if a disaster is declared.

Your plan should include a short checklist for each scenario, written
as a numbered series of specific actions. For example, for an online
service outage:

1.  Send a message to the Signal group.
2.  Log into the database management console and click "Restore from
    snapshot."
3.  Check that the dashboard loads and returns data correctly.

For a freezer failure:

1.  Call the lab manager at the emergency number on the printed contact
    sheet.
2.  Move samples to the backup freezer in Building C, Room 112.
3.  Log the time, temperature, and which samples were moved in the lab
    notebook.

> If a step requires knowledge or access that only one person has, you have a
> *lottery-factor* problem. Ask yourself, "If Alice wins the lottery and moves
> to Bali tomorrow, can the rest of the team keep things running?"  This is the
> hardest part of planning by far, because Alice probably doesn't recognize all
> the things only she knows how to do, and no one else does either because they
> are not doing them.

## Tip 3: Back up everything.

Follow the *3-2-1 rule* [%b Krogh2009 %]: three copies of every critical asset,
on two different types of media, with one copy off-site. This applies to
datasets, software releases, lab notebooks, and configuration information
equally.

For our ecology lab, the three copies are typically:

1.  The working copy on a lab server or shared drive.
2.  An automated backup. If your institution offers a research computing backup
    service, use it. If not, use a managed database (e.g., [Amazon RDS][rds] or
    [Google Cloud SQL][cloud-sql]) with automatic daily snapshots (no scripting
    required). For files, GUI tools like [Duplicati][duplicati] or your cloud
    provider's desktop sync app are sufficient.
3.  An off-site deposit. For datasets, deposit snapshots in an institutional or
    domain repository ([Dataverse][dataverse], [Dryad][dryad], [Zenodo][zenodo],
    or [OSF][osf]) that provides a DOI. For software, connect Zenodo or figshare
    to your repository so every tagged release is automatically archived. For
    lab notebooks, scan or photograph key pages quarterly and save them with
    your other backups.

Back up your source code to at least two different software forges, and turn on
automatic mirroring in GitHub or [GitLab][gitlab]'s settings. A `git push` to a
secondary remote is the most cost-effective one-liner you will ever write, but
automatic mirroring is even better.

Back up your configuration as well: DNS records, environment variables, and
pipeline definitions. These are small in size but catastrophic to reconstruct
from memory. A single export once a week, stored alongside your other backups,
is sufficient.

Finally, *test a full restore from backup* at least once a year.  Anecdotally,
about a third of backups fail to restore completely. Remember that you may need
to restore several times in a real disaster. Check that your restore process is
*idempotent* by running it and then running it again: a recovery that corrupts
data the second time is as bad as no recovery at all.

> If you can store backups on a separate cloud account with credentials that are
> not stored on any production server, do so. If an attacker compromises your
> main account, they should not get your backups as well.

## Tip 4: Communicate clearly.

Choose a single communication channel that does not depend on your normal
infrastructure. If you use [Slack][slack], agree *in advance* on a
[Signal][signal] group or a phone tree for when Slack is unavailable. Make sure
the fallback is written in your plan.

For lab and field staff, maintain a printed contact tree: if the freezer alarms
at 2:00 a.m., who calls whom? Post it on the lab fridge and save a photo on
every team member's phone.

Keep a printed (or phone-screenshot) contact list with every team member's
mobile number and a personal email address. Do not store this only in a shared
drive that may be affected by an outage.

Pre-write messages and store them with the plan and in your password manager's
shared vault:

1.  For the team: "This is a declared incident: meet in the Signal group."
2.  For users of your online service: "We are investigating an outage and
    will update you within 60 minutes."
3.  For collaborators waiting on field data: "We have lost connectivity at
    the field site. Data collected so far is safe; expect a delay of [X]
    days."
4.  For afterward: "Service is restored / the situation is under control.
    Here is what happened and what we are doing to prevent recurrence."

Designate one person as the communicator so that everyone else can focus on
fixing the problem. The communicator does not need to be technical: they need to
be calm and reliable. Silence erodes trust faster than bad news, so update
stakeholders at regular intervals (for example, every 60 minutes or at 10:00 am
and 3:00 pm) even if the update is "still working on it."

## Tip 5: Test the plan.

The most revealing test for a small team is to hand the recovery checklist to
the newest team member, give them a test copy that they can break without
consequences, and ask them to execute the plan without help. Every point where
they get stuck is a documentation or automation gap.

If no one has joined your team recently, gather everyone for an hour-long
walkthrough. Present a scenario: "It's Tuesday morning and all of Monday's data
has disappeared from the database," or "The -80°C freezer alarm went off at 3:00
a.m. and no one was in the building." Pick the thing that scares you most. Walk
through the checklist step by step and fix anything that is missing, wrong, or
stale then and there.

Over the course of a year, aim to test one scenario from each applicable domain:

- Restore the database from a snapshot.
- Release your software package from the mirrored repository (not the usual one).
- Download and verify your dataset from its repository deposit.
- Walk through a freezer-failure drill.

Keep track of how long tests take and compare against your RTO. If restoring the
database takes four hours but your RTO is two hours, you must either fix the
former or adjust the latter.

## Tip 6: Watch for trouble.

Monitor the things that would get you out of bed at 3:00 a.m. For online
services, free-tier monitoring like [Uptime Robot][uptime] and
[Healthchecks.io][healthchecks] require no code and are infinitely better than
nothing.

For physical assets, install temperature alarms on freezers and incubators, CO₂
monitors where needed, and power-failure alerts for field stations.  Many of
these are available as off-the-shelf WiFi sensors with smartphone alerting.

Check that your dataset's DOI still resolves and that your package is still
installable from its registry. If your software has a "downloads per month"
badge, a sudden drop to zero may be the first sign that your registry listing is
broken.

Check your cloud bill at least once a month: a misconfigured resource can
generate a catastrophic bill even for a small team. Set budget alerts in your
cloud provider's console at 50% and 90% of your normal monthly spend, sent to at
least two people. Most cloud providers offer free-tier budget alerting adequate
for a small team.

## Tip 7: Lock down your accounts.

Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on every digital account: this is the
highest-impact security measure you can take [%b Smalls2021 %]. An authenticator
app or passkey is better than SMS-based MFA, though SMS is better than no MFA at
all.

Use a password manager like [1Password][1password] or [Bitwarden][bitwarden] for
the whole team.  Bitwarden's free tier is often enough for a 3-5 person
team. Every shared credential goes in the password manager: never send
credentials over chat or email. Print the password manager's recovery code and
store it somewhere physically safe, because if you lose access to the password
manager you lose access to everything.

For physical access, maintain a list of who has keys to the lab, who knows the
alarm code, and who is authorized to move or discard samples. Update this list
as part of your offboarding process; a former team member with an unreturned key
is a risk you can eliminate.

If you have a custom domain, know who manages it: institutional IT, a commercial
registrar, or someone on the team. Make sure that person's contact information
is in the disaster plan, that auto-renewal is enabled, and that at least two
people can access the account. Set a quarterly calendar reminder to verify that
auto-renewal is still working.

Make sure at least two people have critical administrative credentials, such as
the cloud root account, the domain registrar login, the payment method for
infrastructure, and the password-manager administrator account.  These
credentials should not be tied to a single phone number or email address.

Finally, maintain an offboarding checklist. When someone leaves, revoke their
digital access and collect their physical keys as soon as you can. A disgruntled
former team member with lingering access is trouble you don't need.

## Tip 8: Protect your assets.

Make a simple, explicit policy about where things live, such as, "patient data
is never copied to a personal laptop", "database dumps are encrypted at rest",
or "freezer samples are logged with location and sample ID".  If your policy
will not fit comfortably on a single page in an 11-point font, rewrite it until
it does.

> If you are handling sensitive data, check whether your institution has a
> security office, ethics board, or data-protection officer that offers free
> consultation. You may have obligations you are not aware of under HIPAA, GDPR,
> or your funder's data-management plan.

Keep laptops and servers patched: enable automatic updates for operating
systems, browsers, and any server-side software. The inconvenience of an
unexpected reboot is less than the inconvenience of ransomware.

For on-premises equipment like a lab server or a freezer, buy a cheap UPS and
configure it to trigger a clean shutdown when the battery reaches 20%.  Replace
the UPS battery every three years: they have a tendency to degrade silently.

Prepare a short, written response for ransomware. If someone on the team sees a
ransom note on a shared drive, their first action is to physically disconnect
the affected machine from the network and then call the designated incident
lead. Do not try to negotiate or pay without consulting legal counsel: most
jurisdictions have regulations about ransomware payments.

## Tip 9: Stabilize, then investigate.

The most important rule of incident response is, "Stabilize first, investigate
later." Your first goal when something breaks is to contain the damage, not to
find the root cause. This applies to physical disasters as much as digital ones:
contain the water leak before mopping up; move samples to backup storage before
diagnosing what killed the freezer.

Assign clear roles for the duration of the incident: one person leads the
technical response, one person handles communication using the pre-written
messages from Tip 4, and everyone else does what the leads tell them to.

Create an incident log *as you work*: a shared Google Doc or a thread in your
out-of-band Signal group is good enough. Timestamp every significant action:

-   14:32: freezer alarm triggered
-   14:35: temperature reading -50°C and rising
-   14:40: began sample transfer to Building C

The log keeps the team in sync and gives you a record for the post-incident
review.

Escalate early. If you are on a cloud provider's support plan, open a ticket the
moment you suspect the problem is on their side. If the freezer repair
contractor has a 24-hour emergency line, call them before you have finished
diagnosing the compressor.  You can cancel if you fix it yourself, but you
cannot get back the two hours you spent hoping something outside your control
would resolve itself.

Finally, conduct a short review within 48 hours of any incident. The goal is to
identify what in the system allowed the incident to happen, not who made a
mistake. Write down one concrete action item and assign it to one person with a
deadline. If you cannot find an outside moderator for the review, have the team
member *least* involved in the incident lead it.

## Tip 10: Count the cost.

You probably don't have a budget line item for disaster recovery, but you still
have costs. Identify them all:

-   Digital costs: cloud backup storage, password-manager subscription, domain
    and certificate renewals, managed-database fees, repository deposit charges.
  
-   Physical costs: backup freezer space, equipment maintenance contracts, UPS
    battery replacements, field-safety gear, sample-replacement materials.

-   Personnel costs: time spent on quarterly plan reviews, annual backup-restore
    tests and disaster drills, cross-training to reduce lottery factors, and the
    hours lost to incident response instead of research.

Calculate what a day of downtime costs you in concrete terms: lost experiment
time, missed paper deadlines, collaborators who stop trusting you, a blown grant
deadline, or samples that cannot be replaced. For a grant-funded research group,
"cost" also includes the graduate student who cannot finish their thesis chapter
and the field season that cannot be re-run. That number tells you whether it is
worth spending $50/month on a managed database or $200/year on a backup service.
For most groups, it is.
